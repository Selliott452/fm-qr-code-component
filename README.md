## Overview

An attempt at creating a well styled QR code component.

My first attempt at creating something using pure CSS/HTML. In my journey to improve as a developer and try and branch out from purly JVM based development I will be taking on frontend mentor challenges. I am quiete happy with how this one turned out though I'm sure it's one of those things that I will look back on in time and see many opportunities for improvement - despite that I am happy to have my first project under my belt and excited to move on to the next!
